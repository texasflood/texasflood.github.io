These are things I think pass, the standard unix password manager, needs
improving on. Maybe I'll fix them some day.

- When using pass edit, don't just store the file in plaintext format on
  /dev/shm. Anyone can read it there

- Also, add the option to let the user define security settings for their
  preferred editor
